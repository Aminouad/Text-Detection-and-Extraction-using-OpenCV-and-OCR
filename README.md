# Text-Detection-and-Extraction-using-OpenCV-and-OCR

OpenCV (Open source computer vision) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. OpenCV in python helps to process an image and apply various functions like resizing image, pixel manipulations, object detection, etc. In this article, we will learn how to use contours to detect the text in an image and save it to a text file.
Python-tesseract is a wrapper for Googleâ€™s Tesseract-OCR Engine which is used to recognize text from images.
